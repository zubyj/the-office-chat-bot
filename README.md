# The Office Chat Bot

### What it does
Type something and the bot will respond with a line from NBC's "The Office." 

If you type a line from The Office, the bot will respond from the following line in the show.

### Example

Take this [scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_d3teq6pWw) from the office

If you type, "I declare bankruptcy."

The bot will respond with "Hey, I just wanted you to know that you can't just say the word bankruptcy and expect anything to happen"
